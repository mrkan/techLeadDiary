>*Change is inevitable, Growth is optional - John Maxwell*





Let's start by looking at the different kinds of challenges faced by our action set folks -  

The focussed type:
*" I want to talk about the most fundamental problem that I face. I'm very clear about what I want to achieve. I want a healthy, balanced life, make good money, travel the world, all this without compromising on my tall career aspirations. I have taken efforts to write down what each of it means and I have specific goals that I have set. I start out by making time, putting in the effort, yet it all loses steam, and I end up with a pile of unfinished tasks. I don't give up, so I start over, only to have moved forward very little, in each iteration. It's tiring, I know I can do better!"*

The effort type:
*" I give life all that I have to offer, yet I feel that no one cares about me, no one's even noticing!"*


What's your complaint?

What if I told you that this is all set to change? That you can alter many of the aspects of your personal life with some deliberate effort.  

~~To get that kind of control needs an inward journey - of your mind, heart and soul. It requires self-inquiry to make the deepest connection for knowing oneself is the founding ground on which tall, ever-lasting structures of personal character can be built. And we will need every inch of it to create a powerful, new world.~~  


Remember why we are doing this.  
You need to understand yourself to fastrack your efforts to change your progress velocities, get favourable outcomes, get closures. 
The more honest (not harsh, just plain honest) you are with yourself, the closer you are to knowing your true self.
