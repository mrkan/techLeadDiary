 Know yourself 
 =


Let's start with a paradox. My general observation about people is each one of us wants to be the best version of ourseleves. Maybe more. Some of us day dream about this better version. Some of us take action - we draw plans, and we start, we track, and we push and then some more, till...   
*"Shouldn't getting those running shoes and track suit be enough? Shouldn't setting the alarm for the morning and getting the cereal ready be enough? Yet they lie idle."*  
**Why?**  
It's the same for the gym, a new language, a new skill, a new endeavour, and the list goes on. So does life.  

Finding our best selves is a fundamental need for most of us. Yet we have incomplete attempts even when we committed whole-heartedly. Then what's missing?  

This juxtaposition/paradox brings me to my question on human curiosity - Starting out as babies with all that infinite curiosity, have we lost it to logic and reality as we grow up?  
Irrespective of the answer we still need to solve this paradox in our personal lives. Because it matters, to each one of us. This starts a lone inner journey without family or friends.
  
Because this journey requires self-inquiry to question our core beliefs and to work on our biases. This also requires questioning our functioning system. And it also requires understanding that some of the aspects in our lives are not in our control.  

Knowing oneself is the founding ground on which tall structures of character can be built. And we will need every inch of it to create a powerful, new world.

 The following sections present the possibility to assess your personal space.  
 Think of it as a checklist to check your own biases and beliefs.  (A) for agree and (D) for disagree.  
 Make it a pen & paper activity to better engage your brain.  
 Goes without saying - take time to assess. Remember nobody's watching and it doesn't matter to anyone but you.
