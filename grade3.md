With this list, we've created the mould of our hero -  
  <font size="6"> "The Self-led contributor" </font>

### The four actors

### The self-led contributor

### The self-led team
> Match team vibration, contribute equally, willingly!

### The enabler (Org translator)

### The enabled Org

Informal channels of communication
Anonoymity for signalling.
