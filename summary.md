Problem

KNowing


We have biases to take care of which stagnate us, we need reality checks to course correct, we have an enticing pop culture to deal with, we have a science to understand which gives us exactness and objectivity, we need a goal clarity which comes with a deeper connection with ourselves.

solution

At minimum an individual changes.

An individual changes but a team is resistant (but why?). SLC's efforts should cause movement.

A team is enabled but the org is resistant.

Everyone's enabled. 

Beware - It's not coming easy!

Remember why we are doing this  
=


**Self-leadership sets you free**  
It is the inevitable step


**It's infectious**  
A group of SLC can get seniors and other managers to up their game.  
A lower skilled, consistent working SLC can get a skilled worker to turn SLC.

**It's compounding in action**  
(1.0)^365 = 1  
(1.01)^365 = 37.8

Obviously, the above is just to show how small changes yield

We are all *'Work in progress'*


**It's a process over an end goal**


**NUTSHELL**

**WHAT**
A consistent work group

**HOW**

Know who you are. Have consensus with self. Commit to the oath.

Organize your inner work space (OYIS)

Identify the levels at which SLW (Self-led workspace) can be enabled. Set up SLW indicators.

Contribute.

Give and receive feedback.

Inner measure of progress

Keep what works, be aware of what needs to be pruned.

Repeat.
