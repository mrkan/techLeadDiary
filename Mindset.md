The Mindset

Be Consistent

The biggest challenge we perceive when discussing motivation and people is that of consistency, right? It's kind of obvious!  
If we all put the same kind of effort each day, for an entire year, we would obviously have super positive results.  
But then we are humans. There are several factors that influence our effort in more ways than we are aware of. There are unfulfilled desires, someone in the family is unwell, the assignment at hand is demotivating.  
Then there is the pop culture around us that promotes being happy, following our heart's calling and better still to find our purpose. There is a definite pull towards such a culture. It's actually amazing. 

>*"You only live once"  
"No, we only die once. We live everyday!"  
-Charlie and Snoopy* 

Except that there is a small problem. We all know we can't be happy all the time, we could follow our heart's calling our entire lifetime if we had a inheritance written to us and only if all of us have our purposes identified.  

Then you see those folks in your workplace who work relentlessly, often on problems that they don't know how to solve yet. They don't have all the knowledge or information but they keep at it, day in and day out and then you quietly think I wish I were that guy. You wish so because they are there by choice, they are methodical in their ways, and they hold a certain kind of focus about their work. When you ask them they say they do it because it's their job and they feel responsible. Seldom, have I come across someone who's said (and meant) that it was their inner calling or they absoultely love it.  

In short, it would be great to be able to have your inner calling, but till then we still need to operate at our best and this is just a mindset.
And trust me, it can be done - When our tasks & responsibilites are clear, when we have chalked out the processes to be followed for each, then it is a matter of the right mind and time investment for each of the items. Remember the satisfaction of process, if not greater, matches the joy of completion, when done right.

Think of it as a toolkit, a list of TODOs for different kinds of tasks.

It also helps foster a culture where the right questions are asked. When people start identifying you with a consistent approach, they will be able to point out exceptions if you are missing them.

The term ‘self-leadership’ first emerged from organizational management literature by Charles C. Manz (1983), who later defined it as a “comprehensive self-influence perspective that concerns leading oneself toward performance of naturally motivating tasks as well as managing oneself to do work that must be done but is not naturally motivating” (Manz, 1986). https://positivepsychology.com/self-leadership/


Own it!

I have a friend of mine who's come a long way since our engineering days together. He worked as an engineer, then got an MBA degree from a coveted university, and eventually got himself a job with a big consulting firm. We
ve stayed in touch all these years but recently he sounded dejected. 
When we discussed in detail I found that he still worked diligently and he completed his work in time too, and no one was complaining. He was still in the game as in he wanted the promotions and wanted to do better. Then why the dejection. As I probed further, we reached a point where I realized that he did everything right, except for one thing - he was 'doing' stuff that was expected of him, he owned nothing. Is there something wrong with it? No.  
But that day when we closed with a list of actionables that included mostly as to how to increase his ownership at his work and we met two months later, guess what? I met a renewed-in-spirit friend.

Time and again I have observed that candor and ownership are two game changing elements for people who have their motivation and effort in place.
