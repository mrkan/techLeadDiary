*How ordinary employees can build extraordinary, high performance work cultures*

## Getting started

Do you crave freedom and control at your workplace? Do your crave for that feeling of fulfillment, of having achieved something meaningful? Do you feel proud of who you are and what you do at the workplace? Do you wish to be the indespensible craftsman of your work? Do you wonder why you put up with clumsy bosses? Do you hate those recurring Thursday meetings? Do you think people aren't paying attention to you? Can you change all of this?

Each one of us knowledge worker already holds the key to unlock our full potential, to serve as a true leader, irrespective of who we are or what position we hold at the current time.

 There is adequate literature and knowledge that's more readily and easily available than ever before to enable us for the same.  

 Then what's holding us back? 


### Who is this primer for?
There are 2 criterias. 
Firstly, For every individual who spends significant hours of their daily life at a workplace. From freshers to seasoned masters.  
Secondly, this is for audience with a little patience to read at a gentle pace. Because it's that gap between the words that'll give you the true worth.


### What is this primer about?
A concise journal of how to get yourself enabled for the workplace. 

~~### Novelty of the concept~~

I would like to quote one of my favorite modern-day Gurus on personal management  
>*"An empowered organization is one in which individuals have the knowledge, skill, desire, and opportunity to personally succeed in a way that leads to collective organizational success" - Stephen Covey*  

The idea is to build a simple, common-sensical personal framework that can take us all to a desirable state.


## The audacious argument

~~Each one of us (knowledge) worker can be charcterized as follows -~~
Here are 3 misleading notions that we generally hold about ourselves - 
* Principally we are a wanderer, who's drifted along starting from graduation all the way to spending years working and of which we would call a career. It's clarity in hindsight about the past, and for the future, there is next step possibility. Reality - we have controlled far less that how we script it today. 

* We understand little about motivation, about habits and how the brain makes decisions. Hence we have an endless list of unfinished projects - be it health, finances or even learning and those recurring patterns in life. Reality - We often blame too much on circumstance, people, time and other unknown factors.

* We know a lot more about business conduct at workplace today. Reality - In this world of seamingly endless flow of information we are in over-jargonized state with some very important traits such as leadership, empathy, focus etc. 

These 3 notions have a inhibiting effect and hence will need a self-check from you from time to time.

 For now they are sufficient to make my audacious argument -

*I have, myself, given away willingly, the very personal virtues that belong only to me, to some lord of the dark. And to fill the void I now expect external faculties to complete me.*  
-

Isn't it true?  
Don't we blame the entities that we are associated with for not caring enough? For not giving us adequate space and resources to accomplish our goals?

We blame the organization for not giving us the right promotion, or the right hikes, and that they don't care enough about our personal growth?  
We blame the team for not being invested or focussed enough.  
We blame our family for being too dependent.  
How often do we stop to think of the story of our past we repeat over and over? Was it how it had happened?  

Take a moment to pause. What other blames/stories can you think of? Write them down.

The audacious argument is that we have given away way more control than we may have wanted to while organizational leadership frameworks continually reinforce that it's the worker who needs to be provided with enablement. And hence a provider-and-consumer transaction always exists in a place where there needs to be none.  
Can you see your (provider) manager trying to solve your problem at the workplace while being nice to you?  



## The simple alternative

>*"Look within, you are the world" - Jiddu Krishnamurti*

Just as audacious is the argument, the answer is the polar opposite, it's quite simple.

We simply **OWN** what's ours -
* How I feel about myself ?
* How worthy am I ?
* I'm in charge of my journey - what I want to be, where do I want to reach?
* How do I manage expectations

Why should anybody get to tell me about any of these?

Read out aloud -

I am responsible for how I feel  
I am responsible for my choices  
I am responsible for my behavior  
I am responsible for their consistency  
-

Read it again. It's true. Give it a chance to sink in. Imagine yourself at your desk, in that dreaded meeting and repeat these lines. Feel it.  

For those who feel perenially powerless at the workplace, read it out aloud till it gives you goosebumps.


>*"Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes" - Carl Jung*

'But I know it...'. So do I. So does probably each of your working colleague. The catch is while the simple alternative is actually simple to state, internalizing it is quite different affair. For some its a matter of realization, for some it takes years, for others it's decades.  

>*"It's difficult, but that's because it is valuable. By starting early, the power of compunding will bear it's fruit" - Me*
  
Here's the **Call for Action**

By deliberate attention and practice on a set of virtues that belong to me, the very virtues that can be learnt and perfected by understanding the exact art & science behind them, I permanently set out on a journey that improves the quality of existence, be it personal, team or organization.
-


 **HOW** we can go about achieving it forms the following sections of the primer.


I have followed a simple strategy -  
Break - types of people, who am I.  
Fill  - The science, AMOS, Secret Ingredient  
Build - Rewire
