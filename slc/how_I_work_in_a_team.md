How I work in a team
=

Hey, I'm glad you are here. Here's a little primer on how I like to work in a team. Think of it as a quick enabler list that's generally boring and hard to discuss.  
I'm generally consistent with it, so think of it as a snapshot from my brain.  
Disclaimer - By stating these traits, I'm not claiming I have mastered them, I'm on my own journey too.

Self-Led
=
I'm a die hard fan of anyone who is "self-led". It simply implies each one of us is leader by default and hence all our motives and actions align accordingly.  

Being self-led demands the following -
* Have/Present a good character.
* Be self-managed.
* High on personal productivity
* Have and appreciate Candour
* A Do-er.

Character is a bunch of qualities that define an Individual. There is adequate literature on what a good, solid character demands. It's always a pleasure & honor to work with people with good character.

Being self-managed implies that one is in control of their own emotions, thoughts and responses thereof, especially in cases where conflicts arise. We seldom are educated in our upbringing about -
* Managing our own expectations (with ourselves).
* Managing conflicts.
* Managing expectations of others about us.
* Managing stress.

Books, videos, trainings and workshops bring the opportunity of learning these aspects of psychology to the common man. 

Personal producitivity is yet another topic that has become an easy access thing. You'll be amazed at the rich ideas that are available to improve productivity in our daily lives.

Candour is that quality that can accelerate business decisions by manifold. The ability to speak one's mind and say something is right or not, is definitely the need of the hour. Albeit, *how it's said, matters!*
Candour deeply roots itself in the culture that we are raised in, and hence needs all the support in the system to get it going. Hence appreciating Candour, top-down, by actions when opportunity demands, is necessary.

A Do-er is one who "takes tasks to closures". Not the one talking or thinking about something but who gets the job done.

I would also like to believe that self-led people are generally aware of their strengths and weaknesses and are consistent with who they are and what they want out of life, although I haven't concluded on it yet.


I will now share 4 steps to achieving "self-leadership". Assume it will apply differently to each individual. 

Be organized on the inside
=
It's always fulfilling to talk to people who are clear about their thoughts. So spend sometime with your self regularly.

A trait that I have seen with organized people is that they fix things systemically. Instead of looking at the effects, they strike off the cause and get 100x result.

Be sure of why you are doing what you are doing (atleast most of the times). Some of us are in our dream jobs, but some are where their work sucks but they still stay for the pay or maybe because of the location of the workplace. Whatever be the reason, you are there. Make it count, while you are still there.

You are in-charge of your productivity. Have your own system of prioritizing your TODOs each day. This also includes preparedness for a day, to meetings, to a particular discussion.  
Remember, it shows! More importantly, it lights others up.

Move 
=
Set yourself in motion by doing the following 

Understand how **Motivations** work, build your personal (reward) systems accordingly. Use it.

Be **Aware** of how you feel. 'Mindfulness' is the buzz word but Awareness is the big cousin. How am I feeling physically? mentally? spiritually? 

A four hourly check should do. It directly contributes to self-management.

Maintain **Objectivity**. We humans tend to approximate/generalize/ make emperical decisions and they may be wrong. Measure what's meaningful and useful. Maintain a high standard for personal decision making. Keep a record of important decisions made over a long period of time. 

**Action. Action. Action** that's what keeps us all ticking.  
Stuck with a difficult problem? Break it down.  
Analysis paralysis about a feature? Get a verion 0.1 out ...
Feeling low today? Stick to SOP (standard Operating Procedure) of your tasks.  
Apply what you know/learnt effectively.  
Keep moving.

Connect 
=

When you start moving, the world (read your team), is ready to welcome you. Here's a quick enabler list -

Build **TRUST**. First, by trusting your team members and simultaneously helping them build trust with you at every opportunity. Trust, for me, is built by following -
* Being genuine
* Saying that you trust your colleague(s)
* Demonstrating trust in key moments but with correct action steps.
* And most importantly, helping them grow.
* Making a safe zone when they are sharing their ideas.

When backed by Trust, the following is easier to achieve for each team member -

**Express** yourself exactly the way you have to. It requires one to organize his/her thoughts in a manner that the intended audience accepts the content. More often than not, negotiation skills and storytelling abilities are put to test and hence must be developed.

Give **Feedback** where and when it matters. It will save you and your team mate(s) the countless hours of coffee banter with other colleagues. Giving feedback is saying *'Look, this matters. I care'*. If this is the attitude, then you have the golden short cut to getting your viewpoint through.  
Receiving feedback is equally important, seeking for one occassionally is good.  
Experience has taught me that better the trust, more informal the conversation can be, hence most effective the feedback turns out to be.

Always **Align**. We may have all the debates but finally the best *business* idea will win (hopefully). Nonetheless, aligning with the team/business goal is a must. It makes sense to place yardsticks together to make sure that one's concern or the other's blindspot is addressed.

Sustain
=
**Be consistent** at your workplace. We all have our share of troubles in our personal spaces - someone's ill at home, someone's not feeling up to it, someone's plate is too full. Whatever it is, it's either already expressed and the expecations are cleared OR let's expect that there will be consistent output. It's always easy to talk to consistent people. There is a certain transparency to the conversation with them, certain clarity of the time to deliver something or a strong reason if not. 

**Own it**. And that's the big reason why I love self-led people. They work as if they own what they work on. It's their baby and set the priority and timeline for the tasks at hand. And trust me it's infectious. Owning something leads to better self-gratification, sense of accomplishment, and a better done job in the end.

**Keep & Purge** . Keep what works, purge what doesn't in your personal productivity and self-management toolkit. And for this have a self-review (if not a collective one) every 3 or 6 months or so. 

Wrapping it
=
Self-led contributors are the future. Being self-led means, more control with the team, less of managers, lesser iterations, higher velocities, and yes, better engineered products.  
With an highly aware & connected team, the chance to build good relationships and hence a sense of well-being increases.  
That said, some of the traits are hard to find or build. For some it takes years. What matters is the effort to do so from early on. Compounding in time pays big dividends.  
Finally, having well-receiving, self-managing, proactive people are infectious! Be one.
