# Tending to forty

The mind is a beautiful thing.  
What you place on it, matters.  
I call it the 'mindplate'  

Should I be focussed on -
 - gaining tech knowledge OR 
 - grow in the space of finance to earn that 40-90% returns on the investments that I have?
 - Live in the moment like a poet (what I was as a kid)
