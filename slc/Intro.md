How it began
=
It all began around the time when I was about to complete 5 years of work with Siemens, a milestone never personally achieved. So I started reflecting on the years of work put in. I decided that I will put together all the lessons learnt as a team lead at the workplace. As I started doing that, I also spoke with my friends and peers, about my journey and what their personal experiences were and one thing started to get evident - that my tech lead diary had to wait.  

The reason was simple, I wasn't ready to face it, yet. But as ideas and discussions shaped up, I was willing to accept that for all the years of effort I had put in, my net resultant progress wasn't as much. Deep down it always bothered me. It was time to face that question - Am I progressing at my best pace? And the answer to a good degree lies in the people that I work with. The same people, that we spend more waking time with than our family, the same people who equally want to do well and give it their best to work, the same people who aspire to do more, and yet when all motivations and efforts combined somehow made for overall slower progress. And this became my goal to write a simple rule book for the ordinary contributor to create extraordinary results with a team.  
Consider it as one peer's notes for another.  

Lastly, the first few drafts of this primer were unconvincing to me. It seemed the right words were coming together but they didn't seem to convey what I wanted to say. It was this midnight discussion with my sister when I told her about this pursuit of mine when an epiphany happened of the exact how and why I want to write this. It had to be honest and to the point. Hope it makes sense to you.


Who should read this?
=
It's peer work. Initially I thought it was for developers, but then it is everything but technology. So I figure that there is something in it for everyone, leads, managers. Secondly, it's short work. The seasoned readers will inhale it in a short while, the others may take a little longer, which for me is the preferred way to get some value from it.

Why should you read it?
=
It's based on first hand experience, by living it not preaching it.
Some of these aspects you only learn over time. It doesn't need to be so.
When someone asks 'how can I be a better team player?', it's difficult to answer because it is multi-dimensional. Some of these dimensions you will find here.

Why I write this?
=
Sometimes at the workplace, the basic work sanity slips down for  different reasons. For any team mate who feels so faces that dilemma of bringing it up. This workplace sanity must be met to have a healthy working culture so it must be addressed. That's the goal of this primer.  
I have a simple expectation with writing this primer. Wherever I work, I will share it with my team mates to read it so that they know what they can expect from me and likewise.  
If this primer achieves the same goal for a larger set of people then I would say 'exceeds expectations!'.


Getting started

## The distracted self

I will start with the most difficult part of the converation that any individual would have with a peer. It's important because this is one of the most fundamental assumptions when it comes to the workplace. And I suspect this happens to be the *weakest*.  

Here's the assumption

>*"Each one of us wants to be the best version of ourselves each day..."*

Especially, in spaces where it matters, such as in relationships and at work. Yet somehow for all practical purposes, it seems difficult to maintain on a regular basis. Some are doing uninspiring work, some have challeneges at the home front, some have more on their plate than they can handle, while some have all of them combined. And then there is the calling of the greener pastures - someone has bagged a bigger/better role, someone's making twice the money, someone's shifted base to a destination that's on your travel list ... it can go on. So here's the question for you (to be read loudly in your head)

*'Do I bring my best version to work daily?'*

Take a moment to think about it. 

If the answer is *No* , then what is the top (two) reasons that stop you from doing so? Can you list them down?  

I'm consciously counting out lazy people. Yes, they are everywhere. And somewhere later we will deal with them too.


## The limiting org leader
Org leaders are required. They set the vision and the pace for any organization and it's people. But these leaders are humans too and they have their heavy ticket items prioritized on their TODO lists to be done in finite time. And this will be their daily story, it's their job. But the past few decades has also seen glorifying leadership through books, workshops, frameworks and org structures which has made it a distant subject, accessible only to a few. Second, bringing in middle-leaders (as leads and managers) who turn out to also be humans and have their own TODO lists to be done in finite time. In the end they all manage 'resources' who surprisingly are - humans. While this journey has been important it surely has a dead end. The bleed this structure causes to the human spirit and to business is intagible and immesurable. We will see how soon.


## The transferred control
Now what happens when you bring distracted people and shining leaders to gether?  
One, the distracted people want to be the shining leader (which is distant obviously, and it will take effort). Second, the distracted people think that what they lack, the leaders (and org in general) will be able to fill in. While this expectation maybe valid for some cases, most others need a close inspection.
