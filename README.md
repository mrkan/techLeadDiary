**Disclaimer**  
This work is based on observations of over 2 decades of enabling others. The thing about enabling is that it doesn't work till the one who's receiving it is convinced about the enablement. As a corollary, enabling works best when someone needs it as badly as oxygen. This primer will work accordingly for the audience.
I have kept the language and flow of the primer as simple as possible.
Hope you find it useful for yourself or someone you know.

The ones to decide must be the ones closest to the working system.
### Leadership biases
#### Leadership as experience
#### Leadership as a closed circle
#### Leadership as a destination
#### Leadership as a cunning art
#### Leadership via management only

Willingness as the largest deterent. Can we overcome it? - learning about blindspots.
28/7 was a day of connecting with most team members. Realized high on willingness, ok on improvement.


People are motivated by self defined practices, pulled back by processes.
