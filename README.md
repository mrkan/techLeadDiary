We have biases to take care of which stagnate us, we need reality checks to course correct, we have an enticing pop culture to deal with, we have a science to understand which gives us exactness and objectivity, we need a goal clarity which comes with a deeper connection with ourselves.

**Disclaimer**  
This work is based on observations of over 2 decades of enabling others. The thing about enabling is that it doesn't work till the one who's receiving it is convinced about the enablement. As a corollary, enabling works best when someone needs it as badly as oxygen. This primer will work accordingly for the audience.
I have kept the language and flow of the primer as simple as possible.
Hope you find it useful for yourself or someone you know.

### Leadership biases
#### Leadership as experience
#### Leadership as a closed circle
#### Leadership as a destination
#### Leadership as a cunning art
#### Leadership via management only
